## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a front-end developer with experience building dynamic, performant websites using React and TypeScript. My work is focused on creating clean, responsive, and accessible interfaces that prioritize both functionality and user experience.

React is at the core of most of my front-end projects. I use its component-based architecture to build scalable UI systems, leveraging hooks and context for efficient state management. I enjoy working with React because of its flexibility and the ecosystem it supports, which allows for rapid development while maintaining a high level of structure and maintainability.

TypeScript plays a key role in my development process, helping me write safer and more predictable code. With static typing, Iâ€™m able to catch bugs early and maintain better documentation within the codebase. This improves collaboration and ensures that complex applications remain stable and easy to work with as they grow.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find a collection of front-end projects that highlight my approach to building modern web applications. These include reusable components, custom hooks, and full-featured interfaces that emphasize performance, accessibility, and responsiveness. I focus on optimizing load times, implementing best practices for SEO, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility.

Beyond development, I pay close attention to user experienceâ€”thinking through navigation flows, interactions, and accessibility to ensure every app is intuitive and inclusive. I also work with tools like Vite or Webpack for bundling and have experience with testing libraries to ensure reliability.

Feel free to explore the code, offer suggestions, or reach out if youâ€™re working on similar projects. Iâ€™m always open to learning, iterating, and collaborating with other developers in the community.
